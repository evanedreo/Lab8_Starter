### Short paragraph about graceful degradation and service workers. = 
Graceful degradation and service workers are closely related because they both aim to ensure a web application continues to work even under less than ideal conditions. Graceful degradation means building an app with full features but ensuring it still functions when some of those features fail or are not supported. Service workers enable this by allowing key parts of the app like cached data, HTML, CSS, and images to still load even when the user has no internet connection. This helps maintain usability and performance, making the app more resilient and user friendly.
